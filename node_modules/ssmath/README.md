# SSMath (Super Simple Math)

SSMath is an [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) package to easily do math stuff.

# Getting Started

First, we need to install SSMath so, open your Project in Terminal (macOS + GNU/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type in `npm i ssmath --save`.

Now, in your JS file, you can define SSMath!

```js
const ssmath = require("ssmath")
```

If you want to use SSMath faster, and without the use of `ssmath.[function]`, you can specify a certain function you need.

```js
const { Pi } = require("ssmath")
```

# Functions

`ssmath.Pi` - Returns Math.PI, but in ssmath form!

# Upcoming Functions

`ssmath.Random(min, max)` - Returns a random number between min and max!
A couple more functions that will be announced soon...
