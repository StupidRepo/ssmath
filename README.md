# EZMath

EZMath is an [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) package to easily do math stuff.

# Getting Started

First, we need to install EZMath so, open your Project in Terminal (macOS + GNU/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type in `npm i ezmath --save`.

Now, in your JS file, you can define EZMath!

```js
const ezmath = require("ezmath")
```

If you want to use EZMath faster, and without the use of `ezmath.[function]`, you can specify a certain function you need.

```js
const { Pi } = require("ezmath")
```

# Functions

Here are the functions you can use with EZMath!

`ezmath.Pi` - Returns Math.PI, but in EZMath form!

# Upcoming Functions

`ezmath.Random(min, max)` - Returns a random number between min and max!
A couple more functions that will be announced soon...
